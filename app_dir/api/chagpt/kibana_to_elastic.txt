Here are the steps to start the Kibana service and configure it to connect to your Elasticsearch instance:

Download and install the Kibana package from the Elastic website, following the instructions for your operating system.

Once installed, navigate to the Kibana configuration file, typically located at /etc/kibana/kibana.yml.

In the configuration file, set the server.host property to the IP address or hostname of the machine running Kibana and
the elasticsearch.hosts property to the URL of your Elasticsearch instance. For example:

server.host: "192.168.1.100"
elasticsearch.hosts: ["http://localhost:9200"]


Save the configuration file and start the Kibana service by running the following command:

sudo systemctl start kibana

Open your web browser and navigate to the Kibana URL, which is typically http://<server_host>:5601.
You should see the Kibana login page.

You can now start using Kibana to search, visualize, and analyze your logs.

Note that the steps may vary depending on your operating system, the version of Kibana and Elasticsearch you are using,
and your specific use case. You can refer to the Kibana documentation for more information and examples.

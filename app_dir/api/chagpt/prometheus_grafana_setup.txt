Setting up Prometheus and Grafana on a Django project involves several steps:

Install Prometheus: Prometheus is a monitoring system that can be used to collect metrics from your Django application.
 To install Prometheus, you can download the binary from the Prometheus website, or use a package manager like apt or
  yum.

Install Grafana: Grafana is a visualization tool that can be used to display the metrics collected by Prometheus.
To install Grafana, you can download the binary from the Grafana website, or use a package manager like apt or yum.

Configure Prometheus to scrape metrics from your Django application. This typically involves creating a Prometheus
configuration file (prometheus.yml) that specifies the endpoint(s) that Prometheus should scrape, as well as any
additional scrape configuration options.

Start Prometheus and Grafana: Once Prometheus and Grafana are installed, you can start them by running the appropriate
binary or service command.

Configure Grafana to connect to Prometheus: To connect Grafana to Prometheus, you will need to add Prometheus as a data
 source in Grafana. This typically involves specifying the URL of the Prometheus endpoint and any necessary
 authentication information.

Create a Dashboard: Once Grafana is connected to Prometheus, you can create a dashboard to display the metrics
collected by Prometheus. You can use the Grafana UI to create new panels, and customize the visualization of the metrics.

Use Prometheus python client library to expose metrics from your Django application, for example, django_prometheus
is a popular library that can be used to expose metrics from Django views, models and other components of your
application.

Collecting metrics in Django: Once you've set up Prometheus and Grafana, you can use the Prometheus client library
to collect metrics from your Django application. This typically involves instrumenting your code to record metrics,
such as request durations, exception rates, and other performance-related data.

This is a general overview of the steps involved in setting up Prometheus and Grafana on a Django project. Each step
has its own details and subtleties that you should be aware of as you proceed.



The Prometheus Python client library provides a way to expose metrics from your Django application.
One popular library is django_prometheus. Here are the general steps to use django_prometheus to expose metrics
from your Django application:

Install the django_prometheus package: You can install the django_prometheus package by running pip install
django_prometheus or by adding it to your requirements.txt file.

Add django_prometheus to your INSTALLED_APPS setting in settings.py: This will enable the django_prometheus app
in your Django project.

Add django_prometheus.middleware.PrometheusBeforeMiddleware and django_prometheus.middleware.PrometheusAfterMiddleware
 to the MIDDLEWARE setting in settings.py: This will enable the middleware that will collect the metrics.

Create a Prometheus endpoint: In your urls.py file, add an endpoint for Prometheus to scrape. For example:


Collecting metrics: Now the library will start collecting metrics for the views, models and other components of your
application, as well as Django's internal metrics like request duration, database queries and more.

Configure Prometheus: You will need to configure Prometheus to scrape the metrics exposed by your Django application.
 You can do this by adding a scrape configuration in the Prometheus configuration file (prometheus.yml) that specifies
 the URL of the Prometheus endpoint you created in step 4, as well as any necessary authentication information.

You should now be able to see metrics for your Django application in Prometheus and visualization in Grafana.
Please note that this is a general overview of the steps involved in using django_prometheus library, you should refer
to the library's documentation and examples for more information and details.

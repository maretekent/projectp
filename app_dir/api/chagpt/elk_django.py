# Here is an overview of how to set up the Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana (ELK) stack with
# 	a Django application:
#
# Install the Elasticsearch and Logstash services on your server. You can download the packages from
# the Elastic website and follow the installation instructions for your operating system.
#
# In your Django application, install the python-logstash library using pip:

# pip install python-logstash

# In your Django settings.py file, configure the logging settings to output logs in the Logstash format:

LOGGING = {
    'version': 1,
    'disable_existing_loggers': False,
    'handlers': {
        'logstash': {
            'class': 'logstash.LogstashHandler',
            'host': 'localhost',
            'port': 5959, # The port you configured Logstash to listen on
            'version': 1, # Version of logstash event schema
            'message_type': 'django',  # The type of the message (default: logstash)
            'fqdn': False,  # Fully qualified domain name
            'tags': ['django']  # List of tags
        },
    },
    'loggers': {
        'django': {
            'handlers': ['logstash'],
            'level': 'DEBUG',
        },
    },
}

# In your Logstash configuration file, configure the input and output plugins to receive the logs from your Django
# application and send them to Elasticsearch:

# Javascript file
'''
input {
  tcp {
    port => 5959
    codec => json
  }
}

output {
  elasticsearch {
    hosts => ["http://localhost:9200"]
  }
}
'''

# Start the Logstash service, and it will start collecting the logs from your Django application and sending
# them to Elasticsearch.

# Install the Kibana service and configure it to connect to your Elasticsearch instance.
# You can then use Kibana's web interface to search, visualize, and analyze your logs.
